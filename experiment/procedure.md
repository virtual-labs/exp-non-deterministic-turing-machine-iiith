### **NDTM solves in polynomial time = Solution Can be verified in polynomial time**

- **Equivalence of Statements**: The statement "problems solvable by NDTMs in polynomial time" is essentially equivalent to "problems verifiable by DTMâ€™s in polynomial time".
    - Why? If an NDTM can solve a problem in polynomial time, it means there is a polynomial sized computation path where the NDTM guesses the correct solution. This directly implies that if we were to provide this guessed solution to a deterministic Turing Machine, it could verify the correctness of this solution in polynomial time, placing the problem in NP.
- **Fundamental Nature of NP**: The class NP is defined based on this verification capability. The fact that an NDTM can solve a problem in polynomial time is essentially the same as saying that a solution to the problem can be verified in polynomial time because the NDTM's ability to 'solve' the problem hinges on its capability to non-deterministically *always* 'traverse' the right solution path.
