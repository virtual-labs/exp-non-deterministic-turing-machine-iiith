### Aim of the experiment

Non-deterministic turing machines are generalisations of deterministic turing machines in which the transition dynamics is a relation rather than a (partial) function.

Like the deterministic case, acceptance by a non-deterministic turing machine involves constructing a correct run that results in a final state of the head and an instance of the answer pattern on the tape. The difference however, is that because of non-determinism, there are multiple possible choices for the next configuration of the head-tape system. Carrying out all these choices and the concomitant book-keeping is laborious and error-prone. A virtual experiment allows the student to explore different runs through the use of experiment controls.
